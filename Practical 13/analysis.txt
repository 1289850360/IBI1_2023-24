The similarity between human and mouse genomes is 92.53968253968254%, indicating a high level of genetic identity. Their alignment score, which measures the quality of the sequence alignment, is 3137.0.

In contrast, the percentage of identical genetic material between human and rat is 91.74603174603175%, slightly lower than the human-mouse comparison. The alignment score for human and rat is 3107.0.

Remarkably, the percentage of identity between the rat and mouse genomes is even higher, at 96.82539682539682%. Their alignment score is 3261.0, suggesting a very close evolutionary relationship between these two rodent species.

Given these data, it is evident that mouse and rat are the most closely related species among the three mentioned. However, mouse is often considered a better model organism for human studies due to its smaller size, shorter lifespan, and the availability of genetic tools and resources.
