During the formative assessment, I encountered a few issues that I aim to address:

My commit message description was lacking sufficient information.
My explanation for certain tasks was inaccurate.
I neglected to output some lists as required.
To enhance my performance, I have sought guidance from my professors and carefully reviewed the requirements for each task.
